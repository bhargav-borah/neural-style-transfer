# Data Directory

Place your content and style images in this directory.

## Required Images

For the default configuration, you should have:
- `content.jpg` - The content image you want to style
- `style.jpg` - The style image whose artistic style you want to apply

You can use different filenames by updating the paths in `src/config.py`.
